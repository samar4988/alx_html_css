In the previous article, we marked up a functional web form example, introducing some form controls and common structural elements, and focusing on accessibility best practices. Next, we will look at the functionality of the different form controls, or widgets, in detail â€” studying all the different options available to collect different types of data. In this particular article, we will look at the original set of form controls, available in all browsers since the early days of the web.

Prerequisites:	Basic computer literacy, and a basic understanding of HTML.
Objective:	To understand in detail the original set of native form widgets available in browsers for collecting data, and how to implement them using HTML.
You've already met some form elements, including <form>, <fieldset>, <legend>, <textarea>, <label>, <button>, and <input>. This article covers:

The common input types button, checkbox, file, hidden, image, password, radio, reset, submit, and text.
Some of the attributes that are common to all form controls.
Note: We cover additional, more powerful form controls in the next two articles. If you want a more advanced reference, you should consult our HTML forms element reference, and in particular our extensive <input> types reference.
